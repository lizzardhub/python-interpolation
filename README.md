# python-interpolation
This program requires python3 with tkinter available.

Given a set of points (x, y) it computes the Lagrange polynomial (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) to plot a curve, which passes exactly through these points.

input.txt contains lines in format "x y\n", which define the points.
